Synergy Default Theme

## Gulp
Gulp is used for running common tasks such as:
- Less -> CSS compilation
- JS compilation
- Preparation for licensing
- And more.

To run the default gulp task, make sure `gulp` is installed globally and then run `gulp` from the root directory of this theme. For front-end developers, use `gulp watch` to automatically update JS and CSS files on change.
